All data sets manually transcribed from book or government sources.

Initial sources sometimes had an issue where outgoing governments were marked as elected until the day of the election, the same date the new ministry starts; subtract one day from the outgoing government to ensure they do not show up as "incumbent ministers" during later merge.

Manually code prime ministers and "important" ministers (see notes in merge) as important/pm. 

Coding choice: Do not include Ministers Outside Cabinet or Assistant/Associate Ministers.
