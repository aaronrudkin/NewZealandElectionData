# New Zealand Election Data

This is a dataset of all electorate candidates for election in New Zealand from 1946 until the present. Beyond candidate names, party ID, electorate information, and information about who was elected, I also include columns about candidate list position, and whether the candidate served in the cabinet. Every candidate is assigned an ID so this is suitable for panel analysis of election data.

Sources are in the sources folder, including code to merge datasets.

The resulting data is contained in output.csv in the root folder here.
