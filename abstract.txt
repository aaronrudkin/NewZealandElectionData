Although a long body of research has considered cabinet formation from the perspective of parties and coalitions, research on individual incentives to join cabinet has been limited thusfar. Electoral returns, which may stem from particularistic spending powers, cultivation of a personal vote, or party investment, provide one motivation to join candidate. Martin (BJPS 2016) uses Irish data to present evidence for electoral returns from cabinet membership. I expand the time horizon and extend Martin's analysis using a novel electoral dataset I constructed, examining Canada and New Zealand post-1945. In the Canadian data, I find a modest positive effect, smaller in magnitude than incumbency but substantively relevant, and robust to alternate specifications and aggregations of the data. By contrast, the New Zealand data shows little to no effect. Limitations including severe endogeneity in cabinet selection, the observational nature of the data, and the failure of the key result to replicate across institutional and cultural contexts suggest caution is warranted before drawing broader global conclusions.
