1. Ensure in.txt, cabinet.txt, processResults.py, nicknames.csv are present in directory
2. To replicate, ensure that processResults.py is set in "replay" mode (see line 11) and "decisions.txt" is present in the folder. 
3. Run processResults.py, which merges in cabinet information, electoral results, and party list results to generate a final master electoral results list called out.csv


About decisions.txt:
	Decisions.txt captures manual coding decisions made when the code could not decide if two people with similar
	names and information were the same person. Running processResults will prompt the user to make these coding
	decisions and present them with relevant information.

	To change coding decisions, change replay to 0 in processResults.py and delete decisions.txt then run
	processResults.py again and answer the questions with 1 or 0 when asked.
